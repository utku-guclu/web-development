        <h1>HTML Summary</h1>
        <p>
          HTML <a href="#">(HyperText Markup Language)</a> is the heart of every
          webpage. It defines the structure of the webpage and annotates the
          content to tell the browser what to display and provide extra meaning.
        </p>
        HTML Structure & Skeleton There are two big groups of HTML elements:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Elements for presenting and describing your page content (e.g. h1,
            p, ul, a, img etc.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Elements for describing your overall page and for linking to other
            required resources (e.g. title, meta, link, style)
          </li>
        </ol>
        That's why a properly formatted HTML document should have a
        <strong>"skeleton"</strong> that defines two main areas:
        <ul>
          <li><span>"body"</span> for page content</li>
          <li><span>"head"</span> for metadata</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>CSS Summary</h1>
        <p>
          CSS <a href="#">(Cascading Style Sheets)</a> is a language that allows
          you to define style definitions for your HTML document. These
          definitions will be picked up by the browser and control how the
          content will be displayed (e.g. that some text is red, which font size
          it should have etc.).Where HTML defines the structure and meaning of
          your content (and of course also helps with displaying the content in
          the first place - e.g. with the <span>"img"</span> element), CSS is
          used to then present the content exactly how you want to present it.
          It adds no meaning or annotation - it's really just about how things
          look. If oyu want to change text colors, background colors, sizes,
          spacings, distances, borders, shadows, positions and all these things,
          you need CSS.
